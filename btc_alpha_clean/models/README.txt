This folder stores trained model files.

Run 'python train_model.py' to generate:
- ensemble_model.pkl   (main model)
- calibrator.pkl       (probability calibration)
- feature_selector.pkl (feature selection)
- model_config.json    (training metadata)

These files are NOT included in the zip distribution.
You must train the model yourself with your own data.
